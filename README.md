# Fortran-Based-CFD-Solver
A custom CFD solver written in Fortran with Python integration for pre- and post-processing. The solver reads unstructured meshes generated with Gmsh and solves the inviscid Navierâ€“Stokes equations. Python scripts are provided to automate case setup, run simulations, and visualize results.
