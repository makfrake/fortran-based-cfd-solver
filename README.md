# Fortran-Based-CFD-Solver
A custom CFD solver written in Fortran with Python integration for pre- and post-processing.  
The Fortran source code has been developed during a university project and it solves the inviscid Navierâ€“Stokes equations.  
Python scripts are provided to generate mesh (usign a gmsh API), run simulations, and visualize results.
