# Fortran-Based-CFD-Solver
A custom CFD solver written in Fortran with Python integration for pre- and post-processing.  
The solver has an integrated gmsh API to generate 2D mesh. The Fortran-based solver solves the inviscid Navierâ€“Stokes equations. 
Python scripts are provided to automate case setup, run simulations, and visualize results.
